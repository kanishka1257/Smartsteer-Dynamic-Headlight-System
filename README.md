This project introduces a cost-effective, adaptive headlight system designed to significantly enhance road safety by adjusting headlight direction based on steering wheel movements. It aims to provide better visibility during turns by illuminating areas typically missed by conventional headlights. Originally, such advanced technology was primarily found in luxury vehicles, making it inaccessible to many drivers. Our system overcomes this limitation by offering an affordable solution for improved driving experience and safety.





Key Features & Innovations

Adaptive Headlight Movement: The system controls a servo motor to swivel the main headlight, mimicking the steering wheel's rotation.





Cornering Illumination: Dedicated LEDs activate during sharp turns to illuminate blind spots, providing a clearer view of the road.





Cost-Effective Design: Achieved through the use of readily available components like a dual-gang potentiometer, a 555 Timer IC, and LM741 op-amps, making it significantly less expensive than commercial luxury vehicle systems.




Simplified Implementation: The design focuses on simplicity, making it suitable for educational purposes or low-budget automotive applications.


Enhanced Road Safety: By dynamically illuminating key areas, the system allows drivers to detect obstacles earlier and react more safely.

Components Used

TL064/LM741 Op-Amp: Used primarily as comparators for cornering LED activation.





555 Timer IC: Configured as an astable multivibrator to generate precise Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals for servo control.

Breadboard & Connecting Wires: For prototyping and assembly.


How It Works (Circuit Overview)
The system operates on a 5V DC supply.


Steering Input: A dual-gang potentiometer detects the steering wheel's rotation, converting this mechanical movement into a varying electrical signal (voltage).


Headlight Swivel Control:

The potentiometer's output influences the duty cycle of a PWM signal generated by the 555 Timer IC.

This PWM signal precisely controls the angle of the SG90 servo motor, causing the simulated headlight to swivel (e.g., 1ms pulse for -90 degrees, 1.5ms for 0 degrees, 2ms for +90 degrees).



Cornering LED Activation:

The potentiometer's output voltage is also fed to multiple LM741 op-amp comparators.



These comparators compare the steering input voltage against preset reference voltages.


When the input voltage crosses a specific reference threshold (indicating a sharp turn), the corresponding comparator activates LEDs, simulating cornering lights that illuminate blind spots (e.g., LED 1 & 2 for left turns, LED 3 & 4 for right turns).
