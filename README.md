# Smartsteer-Dynamic-Headlight-System
The Smartsteer Dynamic Headlight System is designed to improve road safety by adjusting headlights based on the steering wheelâ€™s movements. It provides better visibility during sharp turns by lighting up areas that regular headlights miss. This cost-effective system utilizes a dual-gang potentiometer, a 555 Timer IC, and comparators for its design.
